# ProRecipes
It's up now. 


	 * 
	 * WELCOME to the source of my eternal pain. I know it's not pretty, some of it's just plain lazy. I know you'll eventually  forgive me. 
	 * 
	 * I have never had time to officially clean up the mess that is this shitty waste of my useless life. That's why I decided to
	 * release it open source, for free. I don't have nearly as much time as I used to. This is for the best. Please submit code 
	 * changes + optimizations etc
	 * 
	 * Thank you to everyone who purchased ProRecipes and left kind comments in regards to it. 
	 * 
	 * I know now that I will burn eternally in H.E.L.L (hairy ecstasy of lucrative lubricant) for this. 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * P.S. I know A LOT needs improvement. Going back I would have done many things differently. This project is a result of a bet 
	 * that I could make a plugin with more functionality and usability than the other recipe plugins out there. Then it turned into 
	 * a passion. Then life hit me. Thus, it's messy and ugly and disgusting and I hate my baby.  This is where you guys come in. 
	 * Fix my baby. 
	 *  
	 * Feel free to make whatever changes you like (without removing functionality).
	 * 
	 * I've left the anti-piracy code commented out.
